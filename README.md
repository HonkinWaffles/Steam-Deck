# Steam Deck + Linux Gaming

This is a blog style repository that contains tutorials on how to achieve specific things with the Steam Deck. Mostly it will be about gaming but as I tinker and experiment with the system it may contain some more unique solutions/projects but for the most part this page will contain information that does exist elsewhere. The objective of this is to catalog the process to get things working so I can easily access them later. I may share them in the future if I find any value in it.

## My weird requirements
1. Artwork + `Deck Mode`
    * The two things about the Steam Deck experience I hate is having to run games from desktop mode and an ugly/messy UI experience. Because of this I will spend hours making sure that anything installed outside of Steam launches from in game mode and has all the proper art. 

1. Save Data 
    * Almost all games outside of Steam donâ€™t have a form of cloud saves, combined with the portability of the Deck this creates a recipe for disaster. With each game/program/etc tutorial I will do my best to include a section handling the backups of any important data

## TODO
I've recently sent my Steam Deck to valve for a RMA due to some problems with strange noises out of the Wi-Fi card. This is a great opportunity for me to get the following quick guides created. 

1. Emulation 
2. Epic Games Store
3. Games from EGS (Epic Games Store)
4. Minecraft
5.
