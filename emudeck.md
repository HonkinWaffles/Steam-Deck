## EmuDeck
This all-in-one application sets up emulators for almost all consoles and some other resources to enhance the experience. 

`Note: This is for most consoles and excludes Nintendo Switch, there will a separate guide for that in the future`

1. Download the install script from [here](https://www.emudeck.com/#download)
1. Right click the application and click `Properties`
    * Select `Permissions`
    * Check `Is excecutable`
    * Click `OK` 
1. Click on `EmuDeck.desktop`
1. Read the popup and click `ok`
1. For this guide I selected `Easy mode` and `Export Mode` will not be covered here
1. Select the location for the ROM folders either `Internal` or `SD Card`
    * Note: Make sure to note down where the ROMS are saved
1. Click Exit 


Once the install finishes there will be 4 new icons on your desktop, letâ€™s go over them now.

1. EmuDeck (VERSION#)
    * This is the installer if you ever need to run it again
1. EmuDeck Tool Updater
    * Updates all the emulators that EmuDeck has installed
1. Steam Rom Manager
    * Handles adding all ROMS/Games to Steam for use in game mode

Finishing setup
1. Acquire some ROMS/Games from whatever backups you have
1. Copy them to the correct console version in your ROMs file
1. Launch `Steam Rom Manager` from the desktop
    * Note: I usually remove the emulators themselves from this list because I launch directly into ROMS from Steam
1. After selecting `Preview` click on `Generate app list`
1. Finally click on `Save app list` 

All games will be added to steam to play in game mode additionally if `Steam ROM Manager` can parse the titles of your games it will also download the artwork. If it is having troubles locating the artwork check the spelling of the game file and make sure it is correct
